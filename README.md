# Introduction
Primary education is a fundamental human right and one of the most crucial factors for human development, but despite the efforts and progress from local governments as well as international bodies like UNICEF, about 258 million children, adolescents and youth of primary and secondary school-age are still out of school for the year ending in 2018. If the current trend continues millions of children around the world will never be able to set their foot in a classroom.

## Definition
The term "out-of-school children" defines the population between the ages of 6-15 years who do not attend schools, who have studied in schools but dropped out before completing their compulsory or basic education, whose entry to schools is likely to be delayed because of financial or domestic reasons or those who are unlikely to ever attend.

## Purpose
By carrying out this project, the aim is to dive deep into data and reveal who the out-of-school children are, where they live, what are the primary challenges they face and what strategies must be adopted to overcome those challenges.
